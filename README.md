# docker-netlify-cli

Minimal setup for using netlify-cli in a docker container,
with the purpose of demonstrating inconsistencies on M1 Macs
when attempting to build or deploy with edge functions.

The example should work on all platforms, but fails on my Mac M1 
while bundling edge functions when using the netlify cli to `build` or `deploy`.
